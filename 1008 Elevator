//The highest building in our city has only one elevator. A request list is made up with N positive numbers. The
//numbers denote at which floors the elevator will stop, in specified order. It costs 6 seconds to move the
//elevator up one floor, and 4 seconds to move down one floor. The elevator will stay for 5 seconds at each stop.
//For a given request list, you are to compute the total time spent to fulfill the requests on the list. The elevator
//is on the 0th floor at the beginning and does not have to return to the ground floor when the requests are fulfilled.
