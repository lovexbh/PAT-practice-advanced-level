//Eva loves to collect coins from all over the universe, including some other planets like Mars.
//One day she visited a universal shopping mall which could accept all kinds of coins as payments.
//However, there was a special requirement of the payment: for each bill, she could only use exactly 
//two coins to pay the exact amount. Since she has as many as 10​5​​ coins with her, she definitely needs
//your help. You are supposed to tell her, for any given amount of money, whether or not she can find two coins to pay for it.
//两数求和问题，排序之后从两边往中间夹逼即可。
