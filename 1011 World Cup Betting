//With the 2010 FIFA World Cup running, football fans the world over were becoming increasingly excited as the
//best players from the best teams doing battles for the World Cup trophy in South Africa. Similarly, 
//football betting fans were putting their money where their mouths were, by laying all manner of World Cup bets.
//Chinese Football Lottery provided a "Triple Winning" game. The rule of winning was simple: first select any three
//of the games. Then for each selected game, bet on one of the three possible results -- namely W for win, T for tie,
//and L for lose. There was an odd assigned to each result. The winner's odd would be the product of the three odds times 65%.
